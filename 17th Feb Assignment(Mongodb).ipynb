    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "    1. Schema-less Database: It is great feature provided by MongoDB. Schema-less database means \n",
    "        one collection can hold different types of document in it. Or in the MongoDB database \n",
    "        single collection can hold multiple document and these documents consist of different \n",
    "        number of fields, content, and size. It is not necessary that one document is similar\n",
    "        to another.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    2. Document oriented: In MongoDB all the data stored in the documents instead of tables.\n",
    "        In these document, data is stored in fields(key-value pair) which make the data much\n",
    "        more flexible in comparision to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3. Indexing: In MongoDB, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary \n",
    "        indices this makes easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the\n",
    "        data. If the data is not indexed, then database search each document with the specified \n",
    "        query which takes a lot of time and so efficient.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    5. Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of Shrading. Shrading\n",
    "        means to distribute data on multiple servers, here a large amount of data is partitioned \n",
    "        into data chunks using the shrad key, and each data chunks are evenly distributed across\n",
    "        shrads that resides across many physical servers. It will also add new machines to \n",
    "        running database.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    6. Replication: MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication,\n",
    "        it creates multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to different server so that \n",
    "        if one server fails, then data is retrieved from other server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    7. Aggregation: It allows to perform operations on the group data and get a single result or\n",
    "        computed result. It is similar to SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations\n",
    "        i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce function and single-purpose aggregation method.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    8. High Performance: Performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistance as compared to \n",
    "        another database due to its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc. "
